As the patellar ossification center enlarges the expanding margins may be irregular and associated with accessory ossification centers. These are most common superolaterally and may lead to the development of a bipartite patella. The bipartite patella has cartilaginous continuity despite the appearance of osseous discontinuity. The patella expands to all cartilaginous contours during late adolescence when the epiphyseal ossification centers around the knee are also in the final stages of maturation. The only cartilage not replaced is that occupying the superior two-thirds of the articular surface (the lower one-third is covered by the fat pad). The subchondral plate does not assume the actual articular contours until the late stages of osseous maturation (after ten to twelve years). Accordingly, typical measurements such as medial and lateral angulation cannot be accurately done prior to the final stages of patellar ossification expansion and maturation (PMID:6729496).', 'synonym: "Delayed bone maturation of the knee cap" RELATED layperson [ORCID:0000-0001-5208-3432]', 'synonym: "Delayed patellae ossification" EXACT []', 'xref: UMLS:C4021597', 'xref: UMLS:C4280446', 'is_a: HP:0003045 !

This abnormality is often associated with other congenital cardiac defects, but it is also seen in the absence of other cardiac anomalies. During early embryonic development, the myocardium is a loose network of interwoven fibers separated by deep recesses that link the myocardium with the left ventricular cavity. Gradual compaction of this spongy meshwork of fibers and intertrabecular recesses, or sinusoids, occurs between weeks 5 and 8 of embryonic life, proceeding from the epicardium to endocardium and from the base of the heart to the apex. Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM) is an uncommon finding. It is thought to be caused by arrest of the normal process of endomyocardial morphogenesis. The left ventricle is uniformly affected, but biventricular noncompaction has been reported, with right ventricular noncompaction described in less than one-half of patients. Because of difficulty in distinguishing normal variants in the highly trabeculated right ventricle from the pathological noncompacted ventricle, several authors dispute the existence of right ventricular noncompaction [PMID:15210614].', 'synonym: "Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium" EXACT []', 'synonym: "Spongiform cardiomyopathy" EXACT []', 'xref: UMLS:C1839832', 'is_a: HP:0001638 !
